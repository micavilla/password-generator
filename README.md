# Password-Generator

## Description
This webpage allows users to generate a random password utilizing a number of user-managed prompts. The page asks the user to select from specified password criteria, and once all prompts are answered, the user is given their randomly generated password in their desired password length. If the user opts out of all password criteria, the page will alert the user to select from at least one criteria in order to generate a password.
